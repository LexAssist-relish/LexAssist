# Indian Legal Databases and APIs Research

## Overview
This document summarizes the research findings on available Indian legal databases and APIs that could be integrated into our legal app for lawyers.

## Key Indian Legal Databases

### 1. Manupatra
- **Description**: One of the largest Indian databases for online legal research
- **Content Coverage**: Comprehensive collection of Indian case laws, statutes, notifications, and more
- **Features**: Uses NLP, AI and ML for information retrieval
- **API Availability**: Likely offers commercial API access, but documentation is not publicly available
- **Access Model**: Subscription-based with login required
- **Integration Notes**: Would require direct contact with Manupatra for API documentation and access
- **Website**: https://www.manupatrafast.com/

### 2. Indian Kanoon
- **Description**: Popular free website providing access to Indian legal documents
- **Content Coverage**: Vast collection of Indian legal documents, including case law, statutes
- **API Availability**: Mentions API services on their website, but details not publicly accessible
- **Access Limitations**: Currently protected by Cloudflare, which may block automated access
- **Integration Notes**: Would require user-assisted access or direct contact with providers
- **Website**: https://indiankanoon.org/

### 3. Casemine
- **Description**: AI-powered legal research platform
- **Features**:
  - Uses AI to connect related judgments with dynamic case mapping
  - Offers "iSearch," a natural language query tool
  - Visualizes case relationships with interactive timelines and citations
  - Supports comparative legal research across jurisdictions
- **Integration Notes**: Would require direct contact for API access and documentation

- **LegitQuest**: Comprehensive database of Indian case laws, statutes, and notifications
- **NLU Delhi E-Databases**: Academic resource with legal updates and judgments

## Integration Considerations

### Commercial vs. Free Options
- Most comprehensive databases (Manupatra, LegitQuest) are commercial with subscription models
- Indian Kanoon offers some free access but may have limitations for commercial API usage

### API Documentation Access
- Direct API documentation is not publicly available for most services
- Would require establishing business relationships with providers
- May involve commercial licensing agreements

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Web Scraping**: If APIs are unavailable, controlled web scraping could be considered (with legal compliance)
2. **Custom Database**: Building a specialized database for specific legal domains
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Using available APIs where possible, supplemented with AI processing

## Next Steps
1. Contact Manupatra, Indian Kanoon, and Casemine directly for API documentation and access requirements
2. Evaluate commercial terms and technical specifications
3. Design system architecture based on available integration options
4. Consider fallback options if direct API integration is not feasible
