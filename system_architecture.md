  - Structured, clean, and modern design
  
- **User Management**
  - Registration/login forms
  - Profile management
  - Email/Mobile OTP verification

#### 1.2 Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material UI or Chakra UI for responsive design
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Voice Processing**: Web Speech API or dedicated voice recognition library

### 2. Backend Layer

#### 2.1 API Gateway
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and security measures

#### 2.2 Authentication Service
- User registration and login
- JWT token management
- OTP generation and verification (email/SMS)

  - Natural Language Processing for brief understanding
  - Entity extraction for legal concepts, dates, parties
  - Classification of legal domains and issues
  
- **Legal Reference Extraction**
  - Law section identification and extraction
  - Case history matching and relevance ranking
  - Citation generation and validation

#### 2.4 Case File Drafting Agent
- Template-based document generation
- Context-aware content creation
- Legal formatting and citation standards compliance

#### 2.5 Integration Layer
- **Legal Database Connectors**
  - Manupatra API integration (commercial)
  - Indian Kanoon API integration (if available)
  - Casemine API integration
  - Fallback web scraping module (with compliance measures)
  
- **Data Normalization**
  - Unified data format conversion
  - Deduplication and conflict resolution
  - Quality scoring and confidence metrics

### 3. Data Layer

#### 3.1 Supabase Integration
- **User Data**
  - Authentication information
  - Profile details
  - Subscription status
  
- **Application Data**
  - Saved briefs and drafts
  - Generated responses
  - Usage analytics
  
- **Cache Layer**
  - Frequently accessed legal references
  - Search results caching
  - Performance optimization

#### 3.2 Vector Database (Optional)
- Semantic search capabilities
- Embeddings for legal documents
- Similarity matching for case relevance

### 4. External Services

#### 4.1 Legal Database APIs
- Commercial API subscriptions (Manupatra, etc.)
- Authentication and rate management
- Fallback mechanisms

#### 4.2 Communication Services
- Email delivery service
- SMS gateway for OTP
- WhatsApp Business API for sharing

## Data Flow

1. **User Input Flow**
   - User enters case brief via text or voice
   - Input is processed and normalized
   - Brief is analyzed for key legal concepts and issues

2. **Legal Reference Extraction Flow**
   - System queries multiple legal databases via APIs
   - Results are aggregated, deduplicated, and ranked
   - Relevant sections and cases are structured for display

3. **Response Generation Flow**
   - Structured data is formatted for UI presentation
   - Citations and references are properly formatted
   - Content is organized into expandable sections/cards

4. **Sharing and Export Flow**
   - User selects content to share/download
   - System generates appropriate format (PDF, DOC, etc.)
   - Content is delivered via selected channel (email, WhatsApp, download)

## Deployment Architecture

### Frontend Deployment
- Static assets hosted on Netlify
- CDN for global distribution
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend Deployment
- Serverless functions for API endpoints
- Containerized services for complex processing
- Scheduled jobs for maintenance tasks

### Database Deployment
- Supabase managed instance
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- Data residency compliance for Indian regulations

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Role-based access control
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with Indian data protection regulations

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling for API services
- Caching strategies for frequent queries
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Resource optimization for mobile devices

## Fallback Mechanisms

### API Unavailability
- Local cache of common legal references
- Degraded mode operation with limited functionality
- User notification of service limitations

### Alternative Data Acquisition
- Controlled web scraping with proper rate limiting
- User-assisted manual lookup for critical cases
- Hybrid approach combining multiple data sources

## Future Extensibility

- Integration with court filing systems
- Calendar and deadline management
- Collaborative features for legal teams
- Machine learning improvements based on usage patterns
